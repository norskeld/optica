# Optica

Minimal, interpreted, statically typed functional programming language.

## Status & Purpose

> WIP.

I have no real aspirations for the language as this is primarily a personal hobby project for learning Rust and language design.

## Planned features

Core language stuff:

- [ ] Haskell/Elm-like syntax.
- [ ] Hindleyâ€“Milner type inference.
- [ ] Type aliases and ADTs.
- [ ] Records (use [this paper by Daan Leijen][records-paper] as a reference).
- [ ] Pattern matching.
- [ ] Module system.
- [ ] Standard library (Prelude).
- [ ] Diagnostic reporting via [codespan] or [ariadne].

These are not as important the ones above, I will do research first and implement them later on:

- [ ] Effect system.
- [ ] VM with garbage collection.
- [ ] Language Server Protocol (LSP).
- [ ] Infrastructure: package management, tests.
- [ ] Interop with Rust.
